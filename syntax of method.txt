Topic:- Syntax of Method

Method Signature:-
method name along with argument is called method signature.
a method is called by the method signature.

Method Declaration:- acces modifier,non-access modifier,return statement along method signature is called method declaration.

Method Definition:-
Method declaration + Method body = Method Definition.

Important Points:---->
1. One method must have only one access modifier will use.
2. One method can have multiple non-access modifier at a time.
3.There are not any sequence in writing access modifier and in non-access modifier.
    for ex- public static void main(String[] args)
                  OR
           static public void main (String[] args)
               OR
           final synchronized strictfp static public void main(String[] args)

Ques:-Design a method which will accept two inputs and it will return big number out of two.
